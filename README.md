# PREDICTION OF DISEASE SEVERITY AND OUTCOME IN COVID-19 PATIENTS USING A SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING-BASED MODEL

### Ilani Dayana Binti Noor Azman (s2003292)

The goal of this research project is to use a supervised machine learning model to predict the early detection of Covid-19 patients' outcomes based on their disease features. The analysis is using supervised machine learning model such as Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. This Covid-19 dataset was collected from patients who tested positive for Covid-19 at Stony Brook University
